# ChangeMaker
A study on ’The Change-Making Problem’

# Description

It is widely known that many computationally-demanding problems require more efficient solutions than to simply search exaustively for the answers.
This is particularly true for tasks that execute repeated operations in considerable amounts of times. 

This project focuses on the famous challenge called ’The Change-Making Problem’ and presents a study on the computational performance of dynamic programming algorithms for solving such problem.

The implemented algorithms were 3, and they all follow the same base strategy to tackle the issue so that a high fidelity comparison could be analysed.
